# who-am-i-game
it is a simple game project using if else [indonesian language].
It's a guessing game using 2 modes, namely survival and just curious.

In "survival" mode, you will be presented with guesses at various levels in sequence. If you fail to answer it. You will return to level 1 again and the automatic score will be zero again.

Unlike the case with the "Just Curious" mode where you can freely look at any available level. and there is no point system.
